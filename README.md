📌 Project Title:
Credit Card Fraud Detection System

📌 Objective:
To develop a machine learning-based system that detects potentially fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time or post-transaction, improving financial security.

📌 Problem Statement:
Credit card fraud poses a significant challenge to financial institutions. Detecting fraudulent transactions from massive datasets while maintaining high accuracy and low false positives is a complex problem. Traditional rule-based systems lack adaptability to new fraud patterns.

📌 Proposed Solution:
Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost that learns patterns from labeled transaction data and classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

📌 Scope:
Analyze transaction data

Handle class imbalance (fraud cases are rare)

Train multiple classification models

Evaluate performance with precision, recall, and F1-score

Use the best-performing model for deployment or testing

📌 Tools and Technologies:
Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, imbalanced-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab or local IDE

Dataset: Public dataset from Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection

📌 Key Features:
Data preprocessing & scaling

Handling class imbalance with SMOTE

Feature importance analysis

ROC-AUC and confusion matrix visualizations

Real-time or batch prediction pipeline
